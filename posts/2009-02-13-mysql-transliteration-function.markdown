title: MySQL transliteration function
author: Ionuț G. Stan

-------------------------------------


In my latest project at work I had to obtain, by means of an
<abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> query, [transliterated][1]
values of certain data fields in our database. And when I say transliteration I
don't mean to transform characters from all over the world into latin characters.
What I wanted was to strip [diacritics][2] out of latin based characters, like:
ş, ţ, ă, î or â.

Initially I thought this should be an easy job as database, table and column
charset values were all set to `utf8_general_ci` and I knew MySQL does well at
comparing basic latin characters against derived ones. Well, it wasn't. Although
the following query returns `true` (or `1`), there's no way of querying MySQL for
a transliterated value, i.e. from the right hand side string to obtain the left
hand side string.

~~~ {.sql}
SELECT 'staia' = 'şţăîâ';
~~~

So what I did was to define a function in which to take advantage of the comparison
feature in order to obtain transliteration. What I came up with might end up on
[thedailywtf.com][3] but despite its apparent stupidity it does its job very well.
So here's the function:
